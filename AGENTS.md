- Preserve the TanStack bootstrap and pinned dependencies when importing content pages; source package scripts are not executed.
- Keep existing source-controlled media as real files and resolve them through shared media helpers so GitHub sync remains self-contained.
- Render news/event photo branding through BrandedPhoto for both thumbnails and image viewers so logo fitting and stacking stay consistent.
- Keep About presentation overrides in a shared browser-safe module and scope layout adjustments to About pages, so imported source content and other pages remain unchanged.
- Keep support-page copy and presentation overrides in a browser-safe support module, leaving the imported source archive intact.
- Mobile navigation uses explicitly toggled, vertically scrolling submenus within the shared reference header; shared mobile-shell overrides have greater specificity than imported desktop rules to prevent off-screen menus.
- Store generated narration as shared media and replay it with native audio controls; playback must not generate another recording.
- Contact and joining enquiries prepare email drafts with explicit status messages, rather than claiming unsent forms have been delivered.
- backendserver/ is a standalone PHP+MySQL service: nested transactions must go through DB::tx (savepoint-safe); never call PDO beginTransaction directly inside another transaction.
- Master Worker requests are HMAC-signed over "{ts}.{METHOD}.{path-with-query}.{sha256(body)}"; the signature path must include the query string in both signer and verifier.
- Run backend tests with the API up (`php -S 127.0.0.1:8090 -t backendserver backendserver/index.php`) then `php backendserver/tests/run_tests.php` against a fresh lifeos MySQL database loaded from backendserver/database/*.sql.
